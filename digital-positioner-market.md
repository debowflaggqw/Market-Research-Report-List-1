<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Positioner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Positioner</li><li>Double Acting Positioner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital positioner market is categorized into single-acting and double-acting positioners. Single-acting positioners utilize a spring mechanism to return a valve to a default position when there is no force applied, making them simpler and often more cost-effective for specific applications. In contrast, double-acting positioners use air pressure to both move the actuator and return it, providing greater control and responsiveness. This makes them suitable for more complex, variable applications where precise valve positioning is crucial.</p></p>
