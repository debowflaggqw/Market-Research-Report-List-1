<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Troponin Complex Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Troponin I (TnI)</li><li>Troponin T (TnT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The troponin complex market is primarily divided into two main types: Troponin I (TnI) and Troponin T (TnT). TnI serves as an inhibitory protein that binds to actin, regulating muscle contraction, and is critical for diagnosing cardiac events. TnT, on the other hand, acts as a structural protein that binds troponin to tropomyosin, facilitating muscle contraction. Both types are essential biomarkers in clinical settings for assessing myocardial injury and diagnosing conditions like acute coronary syndrome.</p></p>
