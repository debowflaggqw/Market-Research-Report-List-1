<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-heated Rotary Dryer</li><li>Indirect Rotary Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary dryer market can be categorized into two main types: direct-heated and indirect rotary dryers. Direct-heated rotary dryers utilize hot gases, typically from a burner, to directly heat the material being dried, ensuring efficient moisture removal. In contrast, indirect rotary dryers use a heating source that does not come into direct contact with the material, preventing contamination and allowing for more delicate drying processes. Both types serve diverse applications across industries such as agriculture, mining, and chemical manufacturing.</p></p>
